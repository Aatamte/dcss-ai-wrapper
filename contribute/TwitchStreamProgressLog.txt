RECAP FROM LAST TIME (Feb 11, 2021):
1. (DONE!) write player current health and maximum health to the gamestate.pddl file
2. (DONE!)add heal action to the pddl domain file
2.5. (DONE!) connect pddl action to the webserver action
3. (DONE) add new goal capability to select the goal of current health == maximum health
   whenever current health is < 50% of maximum


TONIGHT (Feb 18, 2021):
1. (DONE) Discussion: Why I'm doing this
2. (DONE) Add code to catch new g values (solves the smoke problem from last time)
3. Better monster goal; separate out attack from movement actions
    a. Separate move_and_attack actions in move and attack
    b. Make the attack action have an effect where the monster is no longer at that tile
    c. Add attack monster goals into the goal selection part of the planning agent
4. Decouple goal selection from planning; if goal changes, re-plan
5. (Bonus) Figure out how to reconnect to an existing game (Quality of Life Improvement)


Future issues to solve:
* check if time (from the game) has changed - if not we have a problem
* investigate situation where monsters are not being seen
* add smoke to the objects that can be detected in cells
