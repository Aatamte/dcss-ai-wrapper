# Research Effort

## About

This project is under active research development that could lead to one or more publications. If you'd like to help contribute to this goal, read the rest of this document, checkout the gitter where you can ask questions, and submit pull requests with any code contributions. If 1 or more of the following research goals are met, everyone who has contributed could join together to coauthor a paper submission to an AI conference.

## API Development Goals

1. Implement a vectorized state representation to support AI approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning

    **Current Status** (as of 5 March 2020)
  
    - Inventory Items have a vectorized representation that is nearly complete.
  
    - State information regarding tiles around the agent and what they contain (monsters, items, etc) is still needed

2. Implement a relational state representation to support AI approaches from the cognitive systems community, building off of work on automated planning, inductive learning, knowledge representation and reasoning.

    **Current Status** (as of 5 March 2020)
    
    - No state information is currently set up to output a relational representation.

3. Implement OpenAI Gym Capability

   **Current Status** (as of 5 March 2020)
   
   - This has not been started. This effort should probably only start after Development Goal 1 is accomplished.

## Research Goals

1. Develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent baseline

2. Develop a cognitive systems agent baseline using relational representations
